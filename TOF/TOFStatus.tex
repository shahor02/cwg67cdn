\subsection{TOF Detector Status}
\label{sec:TOFDetectorStatus}
At the level of EPNs, TOF collects the information coming from previous calibration runs (NOISE, running before
PHYSICS, the information of which is expected to be available to all EPNs in some way during the subsequent
PHYSICS runs), detector configuration (high/low voltage status, electronics and trigger configuration) from the
equivalent of the Run1 Detector Control System. The aim is to further reduce the data size discarding 
unwanted hits coming from the channels that were either OFF (no LV and/or HV) or flagged as noisy. 

This information (noise and detector configuration) will have to be exported once per run somehow to the 
OCDB-equivalent structure to be available for Monte Carlo simulation. A Run1 preprocessor-like process will be needed to 
prepare the object from DCS and NOISE runs (i.e. not necessarily running on EPNs during data taking). The 
estimated size per run is $~160$ kB.
%1 byte per channel

The estimated CPU time for the process is to be tested in the same framework as the data reduction described
in~\ref{sec:TOFDataReduction}.
