\subsection{TOF Temp}
\label{sec:TOFTemp}
During PHYSICS runs, the TOF data will be checked to spot inconsistent data format, unexpected missing information, 
and errors flags raised by the electronics during the standard data decoding. This will allow to discard suspicious or not 
fully efficient parts of the detector's readout from data reconstruction. 

The information is going to be embedded as an auxiliary data to be sent to the EPNs
at the same rate as the data flow, namely $\sim 20 Kbyte$ per time frame. It will signal which electronics channels were
actually enabled and properly functioning regardless the data reduction process\ref{sec:TOFDataReduction} will remove 
the header and control words of the parts of the detectors not containing any hit. 

The processing time per event will be estimate using the already existing software implemented as DAQ DA and used 
during Run1.
