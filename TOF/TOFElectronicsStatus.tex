\subsection{TOF Electronics Status}
\label{sec:TOFElectronicsStatus}
During PHYSICS runs, the TOF data will be checked to spot inconsistent data format, unexpected missing information, 
and errors flags raised by the electronics during the standard data decoding. This will allow to discard suspicious or not 
fully efficient parts of the detector's readout from data reconstruction. 

The information is going to signal which electronics channels were
actually enabled and properly functioning. Discarding the data from the malfunctioning channels will allow for 
further data reduction in addition to the one described in~\ref{sec:TOFDataReduction},
in charge of removing the header and control words of the parts of the detectors not containing any hit. 

The information will be stored as counters per channel locally on the FLPs while processing the data of one run. 
The run integrated information (channel efficiency) will be aggregated on all the FLPs and written on an OCDB-like 
storage at the end of the run to be used for Monte Carlo simulations. 
It will be an objects of $\sim 3$ kB per run.
%1 word (32 bits = 4 Byte) per TRM to track single TDCs; 38 TRM per SM; 18 SM --> 4 * 38 * 18 = 2.7 kByte 
% the info will be ON/OFF, using a threshold 

The processing time per event will be estimate using the already existing software implemented as DAQ DA and used 
during Run1.
