\subsection{ZDC}
\label{ZDC:datarate}

The ZDC will be triggered either by the ALICE minimum bias trigger or auto-triggered and no continuos readout is foreseen.
The expected data rates for Pb-Pb collisions at 50 kHz are $\sim$30~Mb/s with the ALICE minimum bias trigger (without dead time) and $\sim$160~Mb/s when triggering with the ZDC (there is a factor 25 in the expected rate that derives from ratio of electromagnetic dissociation cross section and the hadronic cross section but in this case we add a dead time due to the VME).

For Run III the ZDC QDCs will be replaced by digitizers with 12 bit, 1~Gs/s sampling frequency and on-board FPGAs that allow fast pre-processing of data. In particular the baseline is measured and its contribution is directly subtracted from the signal. The payload reduced to 3 words for each channel (namely the integral and the time arrival of the signal with high and coarse resolution) with an estimated payload 
of $\sim$600~b per event, therefore no further compression is foreseen.
