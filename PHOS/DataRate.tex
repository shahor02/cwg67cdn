\subsection{PHOS}
\label{PHOS:datarate}

During Run-3, PHOS will take triggered data, like in Run-1 and
Run-2. Raw data format and event size will not change in Run-3, it
will be digitized 10-bit amplitudes sampled at a rate 10~MHz by the
ALTRO chip. Each amplitude is measured by two ADC channels, delivered
from two preamplifiers with high and low gains. The number of samples
is configurable. A reduction of the number of samples without
degradation of the amplitude and timing accuracy is planned for
Run-3. Redundancy of the amplitude measurement by two channels with
high and low gain can also be eliminated. Thus, that the average event
size in Run-3 will reduce by a factor of $2-3$ compared with
Run-1. Table~\ref{tab:PHOS:eventSize} summarizes event size in PHOS
per one DDL link and for the whole detector in pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb
runs.

Given collision rate in Pb-Pb runs of 50~kHz, one expects to have a
data taking rate from PHOS to be 2~GB/s.
