\subsection{TRD}
\label{TRD:datarate}

For Run-3 the TRD will have to be adapted to the higher interaction
rates by modifying the FEE and readout system.  The chosen strategy is
based on using the existing FEE in a different mode of operation which
limits the amount of event data to be read.  The currently employed
mode of reading full zero-suppressed ADC data results in readout times
of several 10~$\mu$s, which will be too long for Run-3 conditions.
Therefore the following alternatives are foreseen:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Tracklet Readout} In this mode only the information on the
  online tracklets is transferred, thus avoiding the handshaking
  overhead in the raw readout mode and allowing event readout times
  between 4~-~8~$\mu$s.
\item {\bf Partial Data Readout} The readout of the full raw ADC data
  would in this mode be limited to regions where TRD information is
  relevant (i.e. where tracklets fulfilling simple criteria for
  electron candidates).
\item {\bf Mixed Mode} If necessary, e.g. for calibration purposes,
  also a mixed mode can be foreseen.  This means that only for a very
  small fraction of events (e.g. $10^{-3}$) the full zero-suppressed
  raw ADC data is transferred, while the rest of the events is read in
  one of the two reduced readout modes (tracklet readout or partial
  data readout).
\end{itemize}
%
The expected data rates are summarized for the first two options in
Tab.~\ref{tab:TRD:eventSize}.  For the mixed mode option no
significant change of the data rate is to be expected, if the fraction
of events with full readout is kept at a small enough level.
