\subsection{HMPID}
\label{HMPID:datarate}

No upgrade of the electronics is planned for HMPID. After the ALICE upgrade the HMPID will be able to exploit its maximum event read out rate
of 2.5 kHz in PbPb collisions, with an increasing factor of 4 w.r.t. Run 1 and Run
2 periods, when the drift time and the TPCread-out rate imposed lower rates. It will be triggered by a down-scaled ALICE minimum bias trigger.
Assuming that in minimum bias Pb-Pb collsions the chamber occupancy is $\approx$ 1\%, the expeced data rate per ddl will be $\approx$ 4 MB/s. 
HMPID has in total 14 ddls (2 per chamber).
