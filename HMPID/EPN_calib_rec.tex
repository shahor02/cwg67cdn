\subsection{HMPID calibration and reconstruction}
\label{HMPID:EPN}

At the level of EPNs the final step of the angle reconstruction has to be executed. The final fully calibrated tracks from TPC are needed at this step for the HMPID reconstruction.
From the DCS have to be retrieved the following parameters: the HV sector voltage values, the chamber pressure values, the radiator temperature values and transparency. 
This information have to be also exported once per run somehow to the OCDB-equivalent structure to be
available for Monte Carlo simulation. A Run1 preprocessor-like process will be needed to prepare the object from DCS.
